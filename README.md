I'd define Big Data as a treasure waiting to be mined. It is big, as the name suggests, in its variety and in its volume. Big data spans all aspects of our lives, as it 
is human-centered & generated. It is seen in academia as astronomical data, marketing as customer behavior, and social media as user feedback. This data can offer many 
insights, and requires specific tools to analyze. It is a crossroads of the disciples of research, science, and statistics. 
This photo is from my Spring Break trip to New York with my best friends. It was one of the most fun & memorable times of my life, and was taken in Central Park.
